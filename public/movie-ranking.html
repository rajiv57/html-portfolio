<h1>The Best Movies According To Rajiv</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h2>Shutter Island</h2>
<p>
 <h3>A twisted psychological thriller that leaves you guessing until the very end, Shutter Island is yet another fantastic collaboration between DiCaprio (giving another pitch-perfect and near heartbreaking performance) and director Martin Scorsese.</h3>   
</p>

<h2>Inception</h2>
<p>
<h3>Still one of the best original films according to me, Inception is a groundbreaking action drama with some of the most intricate plot mapping this side of dreams and reality.</h3>
</p>

<h2>Masaan</h2>
<p>
<h3>A film like a poem. MASAAN is a calm, layered work of art that takes us on the journey of two people and by doing so is speaking about the big and small things in this world, like life and death.</h3>
