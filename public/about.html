<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Rajiv Mishra, a passionate and driven individual with a strong foundation in education and a burning enthusiasm for coding and web development.</p>

<p>My educational journey began at St. Paul's Mission School in Kolkata, where I laid the groundwork for my intellectual growth and developed a love for learning. It was here that I not only acquired knowledge but also cultivated important values and life skills.</p>

<p>Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Engineering at the prestigious Jadavpur University. This academic endeavor has not only expanded my horizons but has also provided me with the opportunity to delve deeper into the world of technology and engineering.</p>

<p>Coding and web development have always fascinated me. I find the art of creating digital solutions and bringing ideas to life through programming to be incredibly rewarding. With dedication and continuous learning, I have been honing my skills in coding and web development. It's a field that challenges me daily and keeps my creative juices flowing.</p>

<p>I believe in the power of technology to transform the world, and I am excited to be a part of this dynamic and ever-evolving field. Whether it's designing user-friendly websites, solving complex problems through code, or exploring innovative ways to enhance user experiences, I am always eager to take on new challenges.</p>

<p>Beyond the screen and keyboard, I'm a fervent cricket enthusiast. The thrill of a well-fought cricket match, the strategies, and the camaraderie among fans are all things that I cherish. If you share this passion or want to discuss the latest cricket scores or memorable innings, I'm always up for a lively conversation.</p>

<p>Music is another aspect of my life that brings joy and inspiration. From the classics to contemporary tunes, I'm a devoted music lover. I find solace in the melodies and lyrics that have the power to convey emotions like no other art form. Whether I'm strumming my guitar or exploring new tracks, music is my constant companion.</p>
